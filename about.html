	<h2>about Amy</h2>
		<p>
			I'm Amy Wowak, a central administrator at <a href="http://sus.org" target="_blank">Services for the Underserved</a>. I work in all boroughs of New York City, driving scalable solutions to transform the lives of people with disabilities, people in poverty and people facing homelessness; solutions that contribute to righting societal imbalances. I work primarily in our developmental disabilites and veterans divisions.

		<p>
			Originally from a farm on the North Fork of Long Island, I moved to Brooklyn after completing my studies in lighting design.
		</p>
		<p>
			When not working or learning how to code, I enjoy watching and quoting old films, reading, muay Thai, baking, and avoiding the sun.
